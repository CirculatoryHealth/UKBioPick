The UKBioPick allows extraction of interested UK Biobank (UKBB) phenotypes from tab-delimited phenotypic file (ukbxxxx.tab).

## Requirements
- `Bash`
- `Perl`
- UKBB phenotypic tab-delimited file (ukbxxxx.tab)
- Create a tab-separated file contains Field ID (column1) and Field (column2) (see example [_**here**_]()). You can select Field ID and Field for each UKBB phenotypes in the [UKBB data dictionary Data_Dictionary_Showcase](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/~bbdatan/Data_Dictionary_Showcase.csv).  


## Usage
You must supply at least [4] arguments when running a UKBioPick!

arg1                              | UKBB phenotypic tab file (ukbxxxx.tab)       
arg2                              | Field ID and Field file
